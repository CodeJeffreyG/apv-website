      <h2>Veterinary Technician</h2>
      <p>
        The technician should be experienced with patient surgical prep,
        assisting doctors in surgery, catheter placement, anesthesia monitoring,
        post-surgical patient monitoring, medication injection and blood draws,
        collection and analysis of test specimens, as well as data collection
        and accurate recording in paperless computer system, and ability to

        skills which enables them to communicate well with pet owners.

      <h2>Veterinary Assistant</h2>
      <p>
        The veterinary assistant supports our team of exotic pet and small
        animal veterinarians. You’ll play an important role in bringing comfort
        to our furry patients and ensuring the smooth running of our facility.
        One of the most important Veterinary Assistant responsibilities is to
        ensure all areas are clean for our pets and their owners. We’ll rely on
        you to assist veterinarians with examinations and procedures. Do you
        love animals? Then you’re halfway there! Job requirements include having
        knowledge of how to perform routine tasks, like feeding or bathing
        animals, along with the readiness to care for injured or stressed
        animals that might occasionally lash out (with safety protocols and
        equipment in place, of course). If you’re quick on your feet and have
        the desire to learn how to provide medical treatments to support the
        technicians and doctors providing care, we want to meet you!
      </p>
      <h2>Veterinary Receptionist</h2>
      <p>
        The receptionist handles all administrative aspects of an animal’s entry
        and exit from our facility involving computer record keeping, payment
        processing, vaccination and behavior tracking, and schedule keeping.
        Qualified candidates should have great attention to detail, excellent
        computer and customer skills, and be able to multitask while working
        with our veterinary and boarding teams to keep all aspects of animal
        care organized.
